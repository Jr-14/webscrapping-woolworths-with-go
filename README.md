# Webscrapping woolworths with go
My attempt at webscrapping woolworths catalogue with Go

# Introduction
Unforunately, the cost of living has drastically increased over the past year with almost every item doubling in price. This makes specials and discounts a a sad necessity for consumers to reduce their spendings.

Big retailers like woolworths don't publicly expose their APIs due to security and privacy concerns, and a method to circumvent this restriction is to websscrappe their front store page.
